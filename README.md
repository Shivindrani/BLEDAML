# BLEDAML
It's a BLLE-RSSI dataset and I've trained it and generated the heatmap to find the maximum strength of the bluetooth connection in a place 
BLE Stands for Bluetooth low-energy indoor localization and It aims at high accuracy and precision using radio propagation(spreading the) models and multilateration which are also known as hyperbolic Positioning - "the process of locating an object by accurately computing the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of a signal emitted from the object to three or more receivers" "Also it is a technique for determining the position of an unknown point"
